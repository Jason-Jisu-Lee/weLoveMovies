WeLoveMovies is a web application in which I set up a database and built out specific routes for users to access data about movies, theaters, and reviews.

[Live Demo](https://movies-capstone-frontend.herokuapp.com)

This project demonstrates the ability to build complex servers and access data through a database:

- Install and use common middleware packages
- Receive requests through routes
- Use of error handlers for when the route does not exist
- Build an API following RESTful design principles
- Create a connection to your database with Knex
- Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server
- Return joined and nested data with Knex
- Write database migrations using Knex's migration tool
- Deploy your backend server to a cloud service

### Tools used
PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, Heroku
